# handGuesture

This is a hand Guesture Project written during my second and Third Semester.It uses a kinect as a depth camera for obtaining the hand.A newral network was trained to predict the numbers written in the air.A modified version is found in #handGuesture2 were I used the Caffe Library for tthe neural network.
